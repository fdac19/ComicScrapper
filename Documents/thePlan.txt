Hey guys so this is the plan we've gotten up until now.
This was discussed between Sai and I, and we were hoping 
you guys would be okay with it!

Sai: 

Is working on textual analysis for interupting the dialogue of characters or
in between characters. Hoping to get at least character's attitude, and possibly 
attitude toward a person.

Chase:

Creating the image classifer that will be able to determine fights between characters,
unqie characters, romanantic actions, dialogue, narration, and possibly more depending on
what other training data I can gather.

Noah:

Working on the Electron window and majority of front end. This would include setting up
the bio page with the rough mock up from the GroupMe (or pick whatever you find more
visually appealing, we have faith in ya).

Casey: 

Casey has put in the most work already lol. However, Casey will be either helping Noah
with front end (you guys could discuss that. Also you could help me in labelling
and catergorizing all the training data I'll be using this weekend for the image 
classifer!
