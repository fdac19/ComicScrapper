# ComicScrapper
The comic scraping project is meant to be used for establishing specific characters within a select series. This allows the reader to hop into a series with knowning enough background knowledge on most characters to be able to pick up whenever in the series.

Currently we are scraping using a python script which graps all the jpegs for that select issue, which will later scrap the entire series. 

To interupt the data we are using machine learning models to analyze both comics artwork as well as their text. 

This project is also being hosted off an Electrion application.
